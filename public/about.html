<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello world! My name is Jacob and I am starting my path to becoming a coder! 
  A Little about me, I have been building and fixing computers since 2008 and that's when I became a computer nerd.. 
  I love everything about tech and I can't wait to see how it evolves over time! I am also a huge gamer and I love everything about space! 
  I wanted to learn how to code because it's something new and it's an amazing career path!
